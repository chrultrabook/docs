# Supported Devices and Platforms
Supported devices are listed in the table below, grouped by platform/family. If your device is not listed, it is not supported. Support is determined entirely and exclusively by the boardname. Use your Chromebook's boardname to see if it has support. 

## Determining Device Support
What's in a name? All ChromeOS devices have a board/device name, which determines which firmware, OS build, etc a device uses. The board name is listed at the bottom of both the Recovery Mode and Developer Mode screens, as part of the hardware ID (HWID).

The chart below provides a full list of all ChromeOS devices currently supported by MrChromebox's Firmware Utility Script, the firmware types available for each, the hardware write-protect method used, and notes for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. 

In most cases, all of the devices in a given platform/family are supported, but sometimes there are exceptions (especially with older or newer devices). The goal is to offer both RW_LEGACY and UEFI Full ROM firmware for all devices, so you may have the option of dual booting ChromeOS, or liberating your device completely :)

Be aware that EOL (End Of Life) devices **DO NOT** have RW_Legacy avaliable

### OS Support

A device having firmware available (either RW_LEGACY or UEFI Full ROM) does not imply any level of functionality when running an OS other than ChromeOS. Some devices/platforms are better supported in some Linux distros vs others. Some devices/platforms are better supported under Windows than others.

## Supported Platforms

| Intel | AMD | ARM |
| - | - | - |
| Intel platforms have good support for both Linux and Windows. Some have support for macOS. | Stoneyridge support in Windows is questionable, and installing a custom kernel is required to get working audio in Linux. Ryzen has support for both Linux and Windows. MacOS is **untested** on AMD platforms. | Currently unsupported by the Chrultrabook dev team. [PostmarketOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Chrome_OS_devices) has support for a few ARM Chromebooks. |

If your device isn't listed, it doesn't have support.

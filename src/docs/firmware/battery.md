# Disabling Write Protect via Battery

::: warning
This method requires opening your device. Be sure to use the correct tools to prevent hardware damage.
:::

## Step 1: Open the device and disconnect the battery

1. Power down your device. Close the lid and flip it over.
2. Take out all of the screws.

::: tip
Screws may be underneath "feet", or the material (usually rubber) that keeps the Chromebook from sliding.
:::

3. Gently pry the back off the Chromebook. If you do not have the proper tools a dull knife would be helpful.
   * On some Chromebooks, the keyboard needs to be removed instead of the back. Be careful as there's a ribbon wire underneath that needs disconnecting first.
4. Unplug the battery connector. You do not need to take the entire battery out of the Chromebook.

## Step 2: Boot using AC power, and flash.

1. Plug the Chromebook into a power adapter.

::: tip
There is a 15V USB-C PD requirement for booting without the battery.
:::

2. Boot the chromebook up
   * If you removed the keyboard, make sure to reattach it for this step.
3. Contmnue to [Flashing Firmware](flashing-firmware.md)

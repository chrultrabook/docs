You should avoid buying any devices in this list.

- Samsung Chromebox Series 3 (STUMPY): DisplayPort output is non-functional under Windows, and VGA output through the DVI port is non-functional.

## Firmware

- **All ARM Chromebooks**: No support, though development is slowly starting.
- GeminiLake: Legacy boot mode/alternative firmware menu works but does not show payload list
- AMD Stoneyridge: Some Stoney Ridge devices may not currently have functional Legacy Boot Mode due to bugs in Google's firmware.
- AMD Cezanne: legacy boot mode/alternative firmware menu works, edk2 boots, but screen backlight is off. Will be fixed in next Google fw update (fingers crossed).

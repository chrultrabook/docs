## Asking for help properly

If you are facing a issue, please read the [FAQ](../faq.md) first.

::: tip
When asking for help, ask in English. We can't help you if we do not understand the question. Using a translator is fine.
:::

**Do not use manufacturer's model name or serial number when asking for help** (i.e: HP Chromebook 14a), it doesn't help with identifying the machine. Provide the boardname, otherwise your support request will be ignored.

If you do not know where to find your boardname, take a look [here](system-info.md).

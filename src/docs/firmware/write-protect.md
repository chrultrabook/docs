# Disabling Write Protect

::: tip
You do not have to disable write protect if flashing [RW_Legacy](about.md#rw_legacy).
:::

Refer to the [supported devices list](supported-devices.md) to figure out which method you need to use to disable write-protect on your device.

Depending on your device, you will need to do **one** of the following:

- Take out a WP screw
- [Unplug your battery](battery.md)
- Bridge two jumpers
- [Use a SuzyQable](suzyq.md) (A cable that enables CCD (Closed Case Debugging))

::: warning
On devices with a Ti50 security chip (2023+), you will additionally need to [disable RO verification](ti50-ap-ro.md).

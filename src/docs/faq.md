## General questions

### What OS should I use?

- This depends on your use case. Only you can answer this question. <!-- Not ubuntu plz -->

### Should I use rw-legacy or full rom?

- This depends on what you are looking to use your device for. If you are planning on installing Windows or macOS you need to use full rom. Rw-legacy only supports linux.

### My internal keyboard doesn't work, can I use an external keyboard to get into developer mode?

- No. The hotkeys will only work on the internal keyboard. Chromeboxes do not have this restriction.

### I just want to boot Linux from USB on my Chromebook, what do I need to do?

- Check the Supported Devices page, to ensure your device has functional RW_LEGACY firmware available. If so, flash RWL (RW_LEGACY firmware) and use that.

### Can I disable power-on when I open my Chromebook?

- No. In what situation would you open your Chromebook without the intention of turning it on anyways.

### My Chromebook powers back on when I turn it off. How can I fix this?

- You Do not. Specific Chromebooks have this bug which takes too much effort to debug. If you were looking to disable power-on when you open the lid because of this, they are completely unrelated.

### I just installed the UEFI firmware, and now my device boots to a black screen that says 'shell' - what do I do?

- you are in the EFI shell; the firmware boots there when it can't find a valid UEFI boot device, either externally (USB, SD) or internally. Just type `exit` to get back to the the UEFI settings menu.

### Should I install 32 or 64-bit OS?

- The UEFI Full ROM firmware only supports 64-bit OS, so be sure to use the 'x86_64' version of whatever OS you want to install. USB media created from 32-bit ISOs will simply fail to boot.

### I'm running Legacy boot firmware now - can I switch to the UEFI firmware?

- If you are using SeaBIOS, you will likely need to re-install your operating system. Otherwise it should work fine.

### Help! I can't exit Developer Mode

- If you are trying to exit Developer Mode but get the error `WARNING: TONORM prohibited by GBB_FORCE_DEV_SWITCH_ON` or find the `Return to secure mode` button missing, you need to reset your GBB flags. You can do that by running [MrChromebox's firmware utility script](https://mrchromebox.tech/#fwscript) and selecting `3) Set Boot Options (GBB flags)`, followed by `5) Reset to factory default`.
  - Then exit developer mode by choosing "Return to secure mode" on the bootup screen

### Can I modify the fan speed?

- Yes, using ectool. To set the fan to auto, run: `ectool autofanctrl`. To specify a percentage, run `ectool fanduty [0-100]`.

### Can I overclock the fan?

- No.

### I want to buy a Chromebook to run Windows or Linux or macOS -- which should I buy?

- Any 64 bit Chromebook should work in Windows and Linux. Some require paid drivers (Windows only). For information on macOS requirements, see [this page](installing/installing-macos.md).

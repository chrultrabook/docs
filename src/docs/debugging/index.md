# Debugging

## Grabbing Logs

- If you are experiencing firmware bugs, provide output from `cbmem` console.
- If you are experiencing issues with Linux, provide output from `dmesg`, `dmidecode` and `journalctl` or `/var/log/messages`, respectively
- If you are experiencing issues with Windows, provide screenshots from Device Manager, Event Viewer, coredumps etc.
- If you are experiencing issues with macOS, please ask for help using the [Chrultrabook Forums](https://forum.chrultrabook.com/).

## Firmware

To debug firmware, you will need the following tools:

1. `cbmem` - To view Coreboot logs
2. `ectool` - To interface with ChromeOS Embedded Controller
3. SuzyQ - If you are experiencing severe system instability (lockups, crashes), preventing you from on-device debugging.

To dump the cbmem buffer, follow these steps:

1. Download the tar archive from MrChromebox's website:
   - `wget https://mrchromebox.tech/files/util/cbmem.tar.gz`
2. Unzip the file and give the binary executable permissions:
   - `tar -xf cbmem.tar.gz;rm cbmem.tar.gz;chmod +x cbmem`
3. Run `cbmem` and pipe its output to `cbmem.log` file:
   - `sudo ./cbmem -1 > cbmem.log`
4. Upload `cbmem.log` file for further analysis.

To interface with the Embedded Controller:

1. Download the tar archive from MrChromebox's website:
   - `wget https://mrchromebox.tech/files/util/ectool.tar.gz`
2. Unzip the file and give the binary executable permissions:
   - `tar -xf ectool.tar.gz;rm ectool.tar.gz;chmod +x ectool`
3. Issue commands to EC by executing commands, for example setting the fan to 100%:
   - `sudo ./ectool --name=cros_ec fanduty 100`
   - Running `./ectool help` will provide you with a list of available commands, or you can [take a look at ectool's source code directly](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/master/util/ectool.c#63)

## SuzyQ Debug Cable

If you need to use SuzyQ, you can use `minicom` or `picocom` for example. It exposes three serial devices:

1. AP (CR50) console under /dev/ttyUSB0:
   - `minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200`
2. Coreboot/platform serial under /dev/ttyUSB1:
   - `minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB1 -b 115200`
3. Embedded Controller console under /dev/ttyUSB2
   - `minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2 -b 115200`

- Platform serial can be used to debug the payload or kernel, but you need to re-compile coreboot with following configuration options enabled:
  `CONSOLE_SERIAL=y`
  `EDK2_SERIAL_SUPPORT=y`
- To use SuzyQ as platform debugger, you will also need to append the following to your kernel commandline:
  `loglevel=15 console=ttyS4,115200n8`

## ACPI and Linux kernelspace

1. Download our debugging script.
   - `cd ~/Desktop;wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrultrabook/linux-tools/main/debugging.sh`

   It will dump:

   - ACPI tables from sysfs (`/sys/firmware/acpi/*`)
   - DMI information (`dmidecode`)
   - Coreboot buffer (`cbmem`)
   - Linux kernel logs (`dmesg`)
   - List of PCI devices (`lspci`)
   - List of USB devices (`lsusb`)
   - Information about soundcards present in the system and their configuration

   Into `debug-logs.tar.gz` archive on your desktop.

2. Run it: `chmod +x debugging.sh;./debugging.sh`

3. Upload this file if you need help with troubleshooting.
   - Remember to remove WiFi information from dmesg to protect your privacy.

## flashrom

Flashrom is used to read and write from the SPI flash

### Read flash

- `sudo flashrom -p <programmer> -r <filename.rom>`
- Example:
  - `sudo flashrom -p internal -r backup.rom`

::: danger
If you have an Intel Chromebook, you will need to add `--ifd -i bios` if you want to write to the flash or else flashrom will fail.
:::

### Write flash

- `sudo flashrom -p <programmer> -w <filename.rom>`
- Intel Example:
  - `sudo flashrom -p internal --ifd -i bios -w stock.rom`
- AMD Example:
  - `sudo flashrom -p internal -w stock.rom`

### Write protection

View status:

- `sudo flashrom -p internal --wp-status`

Enable WP:

- `sudo flashrom -p internal --wp-enable`

Disable WP:

- `sudo flashrom -p internal --wp-disable`

Clear WP range:

- `sudo flashrom -p internal --wp-range 0 0`

Common programmers:

- `internal`: Use this when you run flashrom on the chromebook you want to program.
- `ch341a_spi`: Use this when you use a ch341a external programmer.
- `raiden_debug_spi:target=AP`: Use then when you want to flash using a Suzy-Q cable.

## gsctool

gsctool is used to communicate with the GSC (Google Security Chip) from ChromeOS and is usually used to unlock CCD without removing the back of the Chromebook.

View status:

- `sudo gsctool -a -I`

Unlock CCD:

- `sudo gsctool -a -o`
- This will prompt you multiple times to press the power button, on the last time, the device will reboot back into verified mode

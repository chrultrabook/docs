# Reverting to Stock chromeOS

::: warning
If your device has hit AUE (Auto Update Expiration), you will not be able to revert to chromeOS using the MrChromebox script. You will need to [flash manually](../firmware/manually-flashing.md).
:::

## Requirements

- A PC or laptop to make a ChromeOS recovery USB.
- An external drive like a USB drive or SD card that is at least 8GB.
- Another external drive that contains your stock ROM backup (If backup is avaliable).
- An understanding that this guide has the potential to brick your device.

You can revert your firmware back to stock and reinstall chromeOS.

This is useful if your planning to sell your device.

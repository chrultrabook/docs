# Booting the Recovery USB

::: tip
If recovery fails, [disable write protect](../firmware/write-protect.md) since recovery also attempts to update the firmware.

::: danger
Going through the recovery process will wipe **all** data on the internal drive.
:::

1. Enter [recovery mode](../firmware/recovery-mode.md).

2. Plug in your recovery USB drive.

3. Begin the recovery process.

4. Once its done, setup the system like normal.

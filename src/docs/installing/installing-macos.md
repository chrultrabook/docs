# Installing macOS

Before we begin, it's important to know whether your Chromebook is even supported:

- ARM/AMD CPUs are not supported.
- Intel Celeron / Pentium CPUs are not supported.
- Tiger Lake (11th gen) CPUs and newer are not supported.
- You need at least 32GB of eMMC storage.

**You will also need:**

- Patience
  - This is not a one click setup thing. It usually takes one or more weeks to have a stable hack.
- A USB drive
  - 4 gigabytes or more for a online installer.
  - 32 gigabytes or more for offline installer.
- The ability to use a command line
  - We will not help you if you do not know how to `cd` to a directory.

## Custom Firmware

It is recommended to [flash Coreboot firmware](macos-firmware) with the Management Engine Interface enabled on Skylake and newer.  
Without the ME interface enabled, the following bugs can occur after waking from sleep:

- Blank Electron / Chromium apps
- Buggy video playback in web browsers like Firefox or Safari
- Display/Wallpaper settings in SysPref/SysSettings
- Logging out freezes your system

## Installation

Start by following the [Dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide) for your CPU generation.
Amber Lake Chromebooks should follow config.plist setup for Kaby Lake.  
Add the following SSDTs, kexts and modifications as needed:

### config.plist Fixes

- Disable `Booter->Quirks->DevirtualiseMmio`: Fixes NVRAM and other runtime EFI services

### SSDTs and ACPI Fixes

- [croscorebootpatch](https://github.com/meghan06/croscorebootpatch): Fixes freeze during boot when using coreboot 4.20 and newer. Not needed when custom rom is used.
- [Keyboard Map](https://github.com/1Revenger1/Acer-Spin-713-Hackintosh/blob/main/src/ACPI/SSDT-ChromeKeys.dsl): Maps FNx keys to ChromeOS mapping. This is an example, you may need to do your own mapping.
  - Will need to be compiled with either `iASL` or `MaciASL`.
- [Fake Ambient Light Sensor](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/Source/SSDT-ALS0.dsl): Creates a fake ambient light sensor which is needed by macOS to recognize the keyboard backlight.
  - This is only needed if your device does not come with a light sensor.
  - A pre-compiled version comes in OpenCore's release zip under `Docs/AcpiSamples/Binaries/SSDT-ASL0.aml`

### Kexts

- [EmeraldSDHC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/EmeraldSDHC/releases): eMMC driver
- [VoodooPS2.kext](https://github.com/1Revenger1/VoodooPS2/releases): Fork of Acidanthera's VoodooPS2 which allows mapping keyboard brightness and other useful keys
- [CrosEC.kext](https://github.com/1Revenger1/CrosEC/releases): Adds keyboard brightness, tablet mode, and other functionality

#### Snapshot (cmd + r) or (ctrl + r) your `config.plist` after making modifications

::: danger
If you dualboot with the SSDTs mentioned above, you might run into issues on other OSes. An `OSI_` check is not present in these SSDTs.

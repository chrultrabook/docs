# macOS Firmware

It is recommended to flash coreboot with the Intel Management Engine interface enabled to prevent bugs after waking from sleep.  
Without the ME interface enabled, the following bugs can occur after waking from sleep:

- Blank Electron / Chromium apps
- Buggy video playback in web browsers like Firefox or Safari
- Display/Wallpaper settings in SysPref/SysSettings
- Logging out freezes your system

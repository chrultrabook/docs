### So you're wondering what OS you can install on your newly flashed chrultrabook. Here's a list of pros/cons of every OS.

----------

#### Windows:
Pros:
* Easy to setup 
* Works on most platforms with minimal tweaking¹
* Almost everything works OOTB

Cons: 
* Audio driver is paid (10 USD)
* Thunderbolt driver is paid (20 USD)
* AVS and SOF users experience instability at times

### [Installing Windows →](installing-windows.html) 

¹Some devices such as CELES need workarounds. Additionally, AMD Ryzen devices need several modifications to enable Windows support.

----------

#### Linux
Pros:
* Free audio support 
* Lightweight
* Optimal for Chrultrabooks with low storage / slow CPUs

Cons:
* Potentially diffucult for a new user (depending on the distro of choice)
* Requires some work on the end user
* Outdated audio driver packages on certain distros.
   >**Note**: Anything Ubuntu based will **not** work. Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and ElementaryOS are some examples.

### [Installing Linux →](installing-linux.html) 


----------

#### macOS
Pros:
* Experience is near identical to a MacBook

Cons:
* Battery life is subpar
* Hardware based DRM (e.g AppleTV.app) is broken
* No audio, mic, or 3.5mm support¹
* Doesn't support all devices.
* Takes often up to a week or longer to setup.
* Limited support
  >**Note**: **Any** Celeron or Pentium CPU is not supported.

### [Installing macOS →](installing-macos.html) 

¹On Drallion, audio should work OOTB with AppleALC because it uses HDA, rather than the traditional SST.

## Installing macOS


Before we begin, it's important to know whether your Chromebook is even supported:
- ARM/AMD CPUs are not supported.
- Intel Celeron / Pentium CPUs are not supported.
- Tiger Lake (11th gen) CPUs and newer are not supported.
- You need at least 32gb of eMMC storage

**You will also need:**
* Patience 
    * This is not a one click setup thing. It usually takes one or more weeks to have a stable hack.
* A USB drive 
  * 4 gigabytes or more for a online installer;
  * 32 gigbytes or more for offline installer
* The ability to use a command prompt 
  * We won't help you if you don't know how to cd to a directory.

## Installing Windows


### Installation:

<br>

{: .warning }
Do not use Windows 8 or older. Only recent Windows 10 and 11 builds are supported.

{: .note }
If you want to create a Windows installer from ChromeOS, see the [Installing Ventoy](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/ventoy.html) page.

1. Install Windows from a USB:
    1. On another computer, create a Windows 10 or 11 installer with Rufus as "GPT for UEFI"
    2. Plug the USB Drive into the Chromebook
    3. Plug a USB mouse in for installation (If you only have one USB port, use tab, enter, and space to navigate the menu)
    4. Turn on the Chromebook, press ESC at the POST screen, and select the USB to boot from.

    {: .note }
    If you need to select a different boot device, press any key in "Select Boot Option". Then select "Boot Manager" to select your boot drive.

   {: .warning }
    **Do NOT** unplug the install USB until the installation has completed. If you do so, the installation will fail as the Windows install file won't exist anymore.

3. Bypassing Windows 11 installation checks:
    1. At the Windows installer, press Shift + F10 (Volume Up) to open command prompt  
    2. Type in "regedit" and press enter
    3. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup
    4. Right click setup and create a new Key called "LabConfig"
    5. Right click LabConfig and create new DWORD (32 bit) called "BypassSecureBootCheck" and set it to 1
    6. Right click LabConfig and create new DWORD (32 bit) called "BypassTPMCheck" and set it to 1
    7. Close regedit and command prompt and proceed with installation normally

4. Install drivers:
   See https://coolstar.org/chromebook/windows-install.html for drivers.

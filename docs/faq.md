**Can I pay for Windows drivers using PayPal?**
* You can pay via PayPal in Patreon. 

**How do I buy the Windows audio/Thunderbolt drivers?**
* See [here](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/csdriver.html)

**Can I get AVS or SOF drivers for free?**
* No.
 
**How come audio isn't working on Ubuntu / Ubuntu forks?**
* Because their packages are broken. Please switch to another distro that isn't based off of Ubuntu, like Arch Linux or Fedora.

**What Linux distros are recommended?**
* See [here](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/installing-linux.html)

**Why is there a license error in Device Manager after installing audio drivers?**
* You messed up the license setup. Please refer to the [licensing guide](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/signedlicense.html) and try again.

**Can I hackintosh my Celeron/Pentium CPU?**
* No.

**What OS should I use?**
* This depends on your use case. Only you can answer this question.

**Should I use Windows 10 or 11?**
* Windows 11 is required for TB4 users. If you don't have Thunderbolt 4, you may use both 10 or 11.

**How do I buy Windows audio drivers in bulk?**
* Please ping CoolStar in the [Chrultrabook Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ranFKmUeXc).

**Can I use one driver license across multiple devices?**
* No. One license per device.

**I want to buy a Chromebook to run Windows or Linux or macOS -- which should I buy?**
* Buying any Chromebook with the intention of running macOS, Windows or Linux is not a great idea. Many can't boot anything other than ChromeOS; Those that can boot Linux (or Windows) often have functional deficiencies -- DO NOT EXPECT EVERYTHING TO WORK OUT OF THE BOX. Older models may fair better compatibility wise, but there are still lots of caveats, and it's not recommended to buy a Chromebook as a cheap Linux device.

**How can I get audio working under Linux?**
* Please see [here](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio)

**I just want to boot Linux from USB on my Chromebook, what do I need to do?**
* Check the Supported Devices page, to ensure your device has functional RW_LEGACY firmware available. If so, then simply put your device into Developer Mode, then run my script and update the RW_LEGACY firmware (no need to disable the firmware write protect for this). Reboot, press CTRL+L to boot in Legacy Boot Mode/Alternative Bootloader Menu, then press ESC and select your USB from the boot menu.

**I just installed the UEFI firmware, and now my device boots to a black screen that says 'shell' - what do I do?**
* You're in the EFI shell; the firmware boots there when it can't find a valid UEFI boot device, either externally (USB, SD) or internally. Just type 'exit' to get back to the the UEFI settings menu, from which you can select your boot device or reboot. You need to install a UEFI-boot capable OS from a properly formatted USB/SD device. If you're creating the install media from Windows, use Rufus to write the ISO to USB. If writing a Windows ISO, select the ISO, then set the Partition scheme to 'MBR for UEFI' or 'GPT for UEFI;' 'MBR for UEFI-CSM' will not work since CSM = Legacy BIOS and the UEFI firmware doesn't support Legacy mode. For a Linux ISO, select the ISO, then change the write mode from 'ISO Image' to 'DD Image' from the drop-down menu. As most Linux ISO images these days are compatible with both Legacy and UEFI booting, this ensures maximum compatibility.

**Should I install 32 or 64-bit OS?**
* The UEFI Full ROM firmware only supports 64-bit OS, so be sure to use the 'x86_64' version of whatever OS you want to install. USB media created from 32-bit ISOs will simply fail to boot.

**I'm using your UEFI firmware, installed my OS [Linux], and it still boots to the EFI shell - what do I do?**
* Sounds like your Linux distro doesn't install the EFI bootloader in the default location - no worries, it's an easy fix:
  * Type `exit` to return to the UEFI settings menu, then select Boot Maintenance Manager. From there, select Boot From File, then navigate to and boot from `/EFI/[distro name]/grubx64.efi` (where [distro name] will be ubuntu, arch, debian, etc). Once your OS is booted, open a terminal/shell, and type the following (observing case):

   * `sudo su`
   * `mkdir -p /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT`
   * `cp /boot/efi/EFI/[distro name from above]/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi`

   * Then reboot to test. What we're doing is copying the grub EFI boot stub from the OS installed location to the location the firmware is expecting (/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi) on the EFI system partition (ESP), which most (Debian/Ubuntu-based?) distros will mount at /boot/efi. You may need to adjust slightly for your distro, but these instructions should work in most cases.

**I'm running Legacy boot firmware now - can I switch to the UEFI firmware?**
* You can, but your existing OS install won't boot. You'll need to either reinstall the OS (often the easiest course of action), or you can attempt to migrate your existing install, but this isn't ideal and should be considered unsupported.

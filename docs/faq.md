**Can I pay for Windows drivers using PayPal?**
* You can pay via PayPal in Patreon. 

**How do I buy the Windows audio/Thunderbolt drivers?**
* See [here](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/csdriver.html)

**Can I get AVS or SOF drivers for free?**
* No.
 
**How come audio isn't working on Ubuntu / Ubuntu forks?**
* Because their packages are broken. Please switch to another distro that isn't based off of Ubuntu, like Arch Linux or Fedora.

**What Linux distros are recommended?**
* See [here](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/installing-linux.html)

**Why is there a license error in Device Manager after installing audio drivers?**
* You messed up the license setup. Please refer to the [licensing guide](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/signedlicense.html) and try again.

**Can I hackintosh my Celeron/Pentium CPU?**
* No.

**What OS should I use?**
* This depends on your use case. Only you can answer this question.

**Should I use Windows 10 or 11?**
* Windows 11 is required for TB4 users. If you don't have Thunderbolt 4, you may use both 10 or 11.

**How do I buy Windows audio drivers in bulk?**
* Please ping CoolStar in the [Chrultrabook Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ranFKmUeXc).

**Can I use one driver license across multiple devices?**
* No. One license per device.

**I want to buy a Chromebook to run Windows or Linux or macOS -- which should I buy?**
* Buying any Chromebook with the intention of running macOS, Windows or Linux is not a great idea. Many can't boot anything other than ChromeOS; Those that can boot Linux (or Windows) often have functional deficiencies -- DO NOT EXPECT EVERYTHING TO WORK OUT OF THE BOX. Older models may fair better compatibility wise, but there are still lots of caveats, and it's not recommended to buy a Chromebook as a cheap Linux device.

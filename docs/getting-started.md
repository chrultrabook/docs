# Before we begin, keep in mind the following:


### Supported Chromebooks:

Please refer to [this chart](supported-devices.html) for a full list of supported devices.

-------------

### Asking for help properly:
If you are facing a issue, please read the [FAQ](faq.html) first.

When asking for help, **do not use manufacturer's model name** (i.e: HP Chromebook 14a), it doesn't help with identifying the machine. Provide the boardname, otherwise your support request will be ignored.

--------------

### Provide logs.

* If you're experiencing firmware bugs, provide output from `cbmem` console.
* If you're experiencing issues with Linux, provide output from `dmesg`, `dmidecode` and `journalct`l or `/var/log/messages`, respectively*
* If you're experiencing issues with Windows, provide screenshots from Device Manager, Event Viewer, coredumps etc.
* If you're experiencing issues with macOS, please ask for help in the Chrultrabook Discord, under #hackintosh.

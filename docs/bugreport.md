## Bug Reporting

So you find a bug in one of our projects, and want to report it. It's faily simple,

1. Use your brain (please)
2. Open a issue in our [bugtracker](https://github.com/chrultrabook/bugtracker/issues)
3. Be descriptive. Describe what the issue is, steps to reproduce, affected devices, etc etc.
  - If you need help, a generic bug report template is available.
4. Wait patiently for a contributor to fix the issue.
  - Please keep in mind the majority of us contributors have other things going on in our lives.

Do not submit personal help requests in the bugtracker.

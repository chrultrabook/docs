## Supporting the Docs

Want to help support the docs? Well there's some ways you can help!

------------

### Contributing via Issues

Contributing via Issues is pretty simple but there are some rules:

* Reserve the issues tab exclusively for documentation-related matters; refrain from discussing personal support issues or OS installation problems there.
* When reporting a typo or suggesting better clarification, please specify the page where the issue is found. It would be helpful to avoid searching extensively for these problems.

------------

### Contributing via PRs

Some guidelines when contributing via PRs:

* Use your brain (please).
* Proofread your submissions.
* Pull Requests may be rejected if they do not align with the docs's content or if they contain inaccurate information. Generally, we will provide reasons for rejection or request revisions.
    * Additionally, it would be appreciated if you can provide sources for significant commits. This helps us verify the validity of the information you provide.
* Ensure that the pages adhere to the markdown style used in the docs.

### How to Contribute

The best way to test your commits and ensure proper formatting is by forking the repository, making and testing changes locally, then contributing with a pull request.


**Simple step-by-step guide**

* Install Ruby, Jekyll, and bundle
  * See [Jekyll's installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides) for your platform.
* [Fork this repo](https://github.com/chrultrabook/docs/fork/)
* Clone your fork, open a terminal and `cd` to it
* Run the `bundle` command, then `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Visit `localhost:4000` in your web browser and preview your changes.

{: .note }
Jekyll will automatically regenerate pages when you make changes.

## Installing Linux
Thanks to recent advancements in the chrultrabook community, Linux works really well on most Chromebooks.

----------------

### Recommended Distributions

{: .note } 
Only Linux kernel 6.1 LTS or newer is supported.

{: .warning } 
Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distributions, such as Mint or ElementaryOS are unsupported.

**Recommended distros as of June 2023 (in no particular order) are:**

* Arch Linux
* Fedora
* OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
* Pop!_OS
* Debian 12 (Bookworm)

----------------


### Installation:

1. Create a bootable Linux USB. Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distros have outdated packages and thus are not supported.
2. Plug the USB Drive into the Chromebook.
3. Turn on the Chromebook, press `ESC` at the POST screen, and select the USB to boot from. 
4. Install as you would on any other computer.

### What is a Chrultrabook and who is this guide for?

A Chrultrabook is a modified Chromebook designed to run Windows, Linux, or even macOS by utilizing MrChromebox coreboot firmware and custom CoolStar drivers. The purpose of this repository is to provide comprehensive and user-friendly documentation on hardware, firmware, and operating systems.

--------------------------------------

**The wiki focuses on two main things:**

*   Installing altOS on your Chromebook.
*   Learning in-depth information about your Chromebook.

Because of this, you will be expected to read, learn, and even use Google. This is not a one click procedure.

Finally, those who are still facing issues can ask for help in the [chrultrabook Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tkPTk5w).
